  //find chapter index - table of contents - this can get tricky, many approaches possible
  //easy way to print table of contents is simply use slice only question is can we find the index with program or by hand input
  //so hard coded inflexible way first:
  val tableOfContents = lines.slice(35,48) //not great because only applies to that one book...also off by one errors

  //print and save table of contents
  println(tableOfContents.mkString("\n")) //so same as tableOfContents.foreach(println)
  Utilities.saveLines("src/resources/styles_toc.txt", tableOfContents)

  //ideas to think about
  //we can look for first occurrence of chapter and then go until no more chapters are available

  //the issue is the chapters that appear in begging of each chapter, so we have doubles

  //we might have some other ways of finding the start of table of contents and end
  //possibly whitespace
  //maybe some lines before that?
